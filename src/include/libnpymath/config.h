/*
 * On Mac OS X, because there is only one configuration stage for all the archs
 * in universal builds, any macro which depends on the arch needs to be
 * hardcoded.
 *
 * Note that distutils/pip will attempt a universal2 build when Python itself
 * is built as universal2, hence this hardcoding is needed even if we do not
 * support universal2 wheels anymore (see gh-22796).
 * This code block can be removed after we have dropped the setup.py based
 * build completely.
